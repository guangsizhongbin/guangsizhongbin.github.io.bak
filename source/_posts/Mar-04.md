Boy Scouts of America files for bankruptcy amid wave of potential lawsuits

  Facing a wave of lawsuits over allegations of sexual abuse, the Boy Scouts of America filed for bankruptcy Tuesday in an effort to protect the future of the embattled century-old organization.
  The filing punctuates a tumultuous time for the 110-year-old organization, which continues to be one of the largest youth groups in the United States and an iconic but fading symbol of American culture.
  Youth membership has declined more than 26 percent in the past decade. This dramatic drop in numbers has left the Boy Scouts struggling to find ways to remain relevant among increasingly busy children and parents.
  Meanwhile, over the past decade, lawsuits, investigations and media reports have revealed internal Boy Scouts documents detailing generations of alleged abusers accused of preying on Scouts. An investigator hired by the Scouts said last year that her team had identified 12, 254 victims and 7, 819 perpetrators in internal documents from 1946 through 2016.
  Amid other high-profile child abuse scandals and the #MeToo movement, several states have overhauled their statute-of-limitations laws concerning child sexual abuse, opening the door to scores of potential lawsuits against the Boy Scouts.
  "In a way, this is an acknowledgment finally on the part of the Boy Scouts that they had this enormous problem and the problem is so large that they can't deal with it themselves, " said Michael Pfau, a lawyer who said he represents about 300 alleged victims. "It is a bit of a day of reckoning for the Boy Scouts."
