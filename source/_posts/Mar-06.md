For a president who loves crowd size, India aims to deliver

One of the most nerve-racking moments for any world leader these days comes with these six words: President Trump is coming to town.
Hosting any American leader is demanding enough with the usual requirements of diplomacy, protocol and geopolitics, but with Mr. Trump comes an additional challenge: how to entertain and impress a president who relishes spectacle and cherishes anything that is the first, the most or the biggest.
The British have a queen, so they made a grand show of a state dinner at Buckingham Palace. The French have Bastille Day, so they invited the president to view their elaborate military parade down the Champs-Élysées.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India opted to appeal to Mr. Trump's first love — crowd size — as he stages a rally of more than 100, 000 people in Ahmedabad on Monday after a drive in from the airport along roads where perhaps 100, 000 more will line the motorcade route.
"Some people say the biggest event they've ever had in India, " Mr. Trump told reporters. "That's what the prime minister told me."
Critics said that meeting, like a parade or a banquet, was just for the pictures, with no lasting result, and that the president should focus more on policy initiatives when he arrives in India.
But symbolism has its value as well, and if a major trade agreement is not in the offing, then the Indians are determined that Mr. Trump go home with warm feelings about their country, throwing in a sunset tour of the Taj Mahal and a state dinner as well.
