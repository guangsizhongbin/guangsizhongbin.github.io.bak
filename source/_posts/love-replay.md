So, I still love her, but she doesn't love me. Should I continue to keep in touch with her and wait for her?

[Quora](https://www.quora.com/I-love-a-girl-but-she-doesnt-love-me-Should-I-continue-to-keep-in-touch-with-her-and-wait-for-her) 

Waiting for a person whom you're in love with to love you in return is like being held captive from life. Love is not meant to hurt or cause harm. Love is patient and kind! So I would be doing myself an injustice to wait on something that may never be! Let go of what my wishing for with this person and go find what my dreaming for! That is where the right kind of love will be. Don't stay in touch! Be that guy that shows a woman he is good with or without her!
