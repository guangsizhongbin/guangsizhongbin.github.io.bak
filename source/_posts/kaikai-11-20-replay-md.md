The danger of this wireless-driven revolution in convenience goes beyond hacking. Unlike the traditional "Internet of Computers," which is confined to a digital "virtual" world, the Inter of Things has a direct connection to the physical one. That opens up a disturbing set of questions: What might happen if the computers inside ovens, security cameras or smart cities were turned against us?

According to the text, what is the potential danger of the Internet of Things?
A. Manufacturers have priced the devices low.

Even within mainstream economics, the growth theory is being challenged, and not merely because of a heightened awareness of environmental crisis. In "Good Economics for Hard Times," two winners of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Economics, Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, point out that a larger G.D.P. doesn't necessarily mean a rise in human well-being--especially if it isn't distributed equitably--and the pursuit of it can sometimes be counterproductive.

<span id="inline-blue">Q</span>
The growth theory is being challenged because__
A. it fails to ensure the people's sense of happiness
B. economic growth was promoted inefficiently
C. economists fail to predict the right outcome
D. it is no longer popular among policy-makers

The government removed the cap on student numbers, encouraging institutions to compete with each other for applicants: but admissions rose quicker than staff number, inevitable reducing the quality of education. There's another consequence of marketisation : as debt-laden students head for degrees they think will maximize their earning potential, many vital courses suffer. The University of Sunderland is axing its history, politics and foreign language courses, for example, expressing a desire for a more "career-focused and professions-facing" approach.

Many colleges--often obscure ones of middling selectivity--have converted to universities in recent years, seemingly in the hopes of raising their profiles. But whether there's a material distinction between a college and a university depends on whom you ask--and many people don't know the difference.
