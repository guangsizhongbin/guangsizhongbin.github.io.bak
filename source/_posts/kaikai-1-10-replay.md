复盘是一个不断校正路线的过程，行军打仗，最怕方向和路线错误。方向错误，再努力也到达不了目的地；路线错误，就会徒增到达目的地过程中的困难和险阻，甚至困难会大到让我们达到目的地。而复盘，就如同行军过程中不断检查GPS,校正自己的轨迹是否在正确的航线上。
{% endcq %}

<span id="inline-toc">1.</span> 如何复盘？
(1). 目标结果
	找出刚开始设定的目标，对照实际达成的结果，对比是否达成了目标？
(2). 过程再现
	回顾一下，从开始到结束整个过程是怎样的？大致分几个阶段？每个阶段都做了什么？又都是如何应对的？
(3). 得失分析
	在分析过程之中，哪些地方我们做的好？哪些地方做的不好？复盘必须既对事也对人，复盘每个人在事情之中，哪些地方做的不好？为什么？哪些地方做的好，好在哪里？
(4). 规律总结
	只要我们能够总结出规律，我们就可以掌握和驾驽.

<span id="inline-toc">2.</span> 两个方面的规律:
1. 认知方面 
2. 实践方面

In theory, the U.S. patent system, which gives manufacturers sole rights to a drug formulation for 20 years, should eventually enable other drug producers to bring cheaper versions of the same medication to the market. But companies skirt this by "evergreening" their drugs--adjusting drug formulas slightly, often making gradual improvements, to renew the patent and prevent generics from entering the market.

<span id="inline-blue">Q</span>
The practice of "evergreening" their drugs shows __
A. the inadequacy of U.S. patent system.
B. the ineffectiveness of generics.
C. the fierce competition of drug market.

但是厂家们通过evergereening 这种方式，轻微的调整药品的成分，使得药品的疗效取得逐渐的提高，去更新专利从而防止其它竞争者进入市场。

The truth, but unfortunately, is that few of us really absorb the information we receive. We filter out what we don't expect or want to hear, and this tendency doesn't necessarily improve with age. As a result, leaders simply miss a great deal of the information that's available -- a weakness to which top performers are especially vulnerable because overconfidence so often comes with success.
