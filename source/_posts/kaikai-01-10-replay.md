复盘是一个不断校正路线的过程，行军打仗，最怕方向和路线错误。方向错误，再努力也到达不了目的地；路线错误，就会徒增到达目的地过程中的困难和险阻，甚至困难会大到让我们达到目的地。而复盘，就如同行军过程中不断检查GPS,校正自己的轨迹是否在正确的航线上。
{% endcq %}

<span id="inline-toc">1.</span> 如何复盘？
(1). 目标结果
	找出刚开始设定的目标，对照实际达成的结果，对比是否达成了目标？
(2). 过程再现
	回顾一下，从开始到结束整个过程是怎样的？大致分几个阶段？每个阶段都做了什么？又都是如何应对的？
(3). 得失分析
	在分析过程之中，哪些地方我们做的好？哪些地方做的不好？复盘必须既对事也对人，复盘每个人在事情之中，哪些地方做的不好？为什么？哪些地方做的好，好在哪里？
(4). 规律总结
	只要我们能够总结出规律，我们就可以掌握和驾驽.

<span id="inline-toc">2.</span> 两个方面的规律:
1. 认知方面 
2. 实践方面

In theory, the U.S. patent system, which gives manufacturers sole rights to a drug formulation for 20 years, should eventually enable other drug producers to bring cheaper versions of the same medication to the market. But companies skirt this by "evergreening" their drugs--adjusting drug formulas slightly, often making gradual improvements, to renew the patent and prevent generics from entering the market.

<span id="inline-blue">Q</span>
The practice of "evergreening" their drugs shows __
A. the inadequacy of U.S. patent system.
