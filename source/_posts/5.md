In theory, the U.S. patent system, which gives manufacturers sole rights to a drug formulation for 20 years, should eventually enable other drug producers to bring cheaper versions of the same medication to the market. But companies skirt this by "evergreening" their drugs--adjusting drug formulas slightly, often making gradual improvements, to renew the patent and prevent generics from entering the market.

理论上，美国专利系统，只给药品生产厂家单独生产20年的时间，最终使得其他的药品生产商能够带来更加便宜的相同的药品。

但是厂家们通过evergereening 这种方式，轻微的调整药品的成分，使得药品的疗效取得逐渐的提高，去更新专利从而防止其它竞争者进入市场。
