In theory, the U.S. patent system, which gives manufacturers sole rights to a drug formulation for 20 years, should eventually enable other drug producers to bring cheaper versions of the same medication to the market. But companies skirt this by "evergreening" their drugs--adjusting drug formulas slightly, often making gradual improvements, to renew the patent and prevent generics from entering the market.

<span id="inline-blue">Q</span>
The practice of "evergreening" their drugs shows __
A. the inadequacy of U.S. patent system.
B. the ineffectiveness of generics.
C. the fierce competition of drug market.
D. the lower price of patented drugs.
