<span id="inline-blue">Q</span>
The peer effects have caused people to___.
A. take up smoking
B. become contagious
C. be more innovative

As companies try to scale up their online experimentation capacity, they often find that the obstacles are not tools and technology but shared behaviors, beliefs, and values. For every experiment that succeeds, nearly 10 don’t—and in the eyes of many organizations that emphasize efficiency, predictability, and “winning,” those failures are wasteful. To successfully innovate, companies need to make experimentation an integral part of everyday life—even when budgets are tight.



<span id="inline-blue">Q</span>

A. realize the importance of innovation

Instead, Harari predicts that the key skills they need to survive and thrive in the 21st century will be emotional intelligence (it is still difficult to imagine a computer caring for a sick person or a child), and the ability to deal with change. If we can predict nothing else about the future, we know that it is going to involve a rapidly accelerating pace of change, from the growth of AI to a warming climate. Coping with this level of uncertainty will require adaptability and psychological resilience.


<span id="inline-blue">Q</span>
Harari believes that to be successful in the future one has to__.
A. have hands-on experience in the caring industry.
B. command the ability to memorize tons of new facts.
