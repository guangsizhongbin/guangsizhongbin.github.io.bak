Lots of rich men tweet like the president now
许多富人和总统一样发推特。

This week alone, a plethora of influential politicians and business leaders have at least attempted to use the social media platform with the same air of casual authenticity coupled with severity that characterizes many of Trump’s tweets.



On Thursday, Mike Bloomberg, responded to a taunting tweet from Trump, telling him that their mutual connections had nothing but contempt for him.
“We know many of the same people in NY. Behind your back they laugh at you & call you a carnival barking clown, ” he said. “They know you inherited a fortune & squandered it with stupid deals and incompetence.”

And he was not alone last week in bluntly expressing himself on social media.

Late Tuesday, Lloyd Blankfein, the senior chairman of Goldman Sachs, tweeted late on Tuesday about the possibility of Sen. Bernie Sanders becoming the Democratic nominee for president.

“Sanders is just as polarizing as Trump AND he’ll ruin our economy and doesn’t care about our military.” Blankfein tweeted.

Jack Grieve, one of the authors of a paper about linguistic variation on Trump’s Twitter account, said in an interview that the style of the president’s posts was not arbitrary.

That informality was characterized by short sentences, an abundance of pronouns, contractions, questions and direct interactions with other users on the site, Grieve said.

“The fact that people are imitating him is further evidence that it’s not just random, ” Grieve said. “It’s been appreciated by people who aren’t just political pundits or who aren’t just journalists but who are really in there trying to do this. They’ve appreciated that there’s an art to what he’s doing.”
