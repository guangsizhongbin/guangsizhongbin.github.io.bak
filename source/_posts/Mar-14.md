Apple does not "let bad guys use iPhones on screen"

Rian Johnson, the director of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, has lifted the lid on a secret in the world of product placement — Apple will not allow its kit to be used by a villainous character on screen.
"Apple, they let you use iPhones in movies but, and this is very pivotal, if you're ever watching a mystery movie, bad guys cannot have iPhones on camera, " Johnson revealed in a video recorded for Vanity Fair.
Johnson let the secret slip as he took viewers through an anatomy of a scene in his latest film, the whodunnit Knives Out.
"Every single film-maker who has a bad guy in their movie that's supposed to be a secret wants to murder me right now, " Johnson added.
Apple has long cultivated an immaculate brand image and it strictly controls how its products are used on the big and small screen. An article from Wired as long ago as 2002 pointed out that all the good guys in the long-running thriller 24 use Macs, while all the villains were seen using Windows PCs.
Guidelines advise that Apple phones, computers and other kit bearing the trademark should be seen "in the best light, in a manner or context that reflects favourably on the Apple products and on Apple Inc, " according to the site MacRumors.
But Apple is far from alone in attempting to dictate the types of content and characters brands are willing to be associated with. "All brands have stipulations for how they want to be used and seen on screen, " says Darryl Collis, director of product placement specialists Seesaw Media.
