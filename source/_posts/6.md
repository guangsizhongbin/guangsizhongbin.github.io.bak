Much has been written about the trash problem created by the billions of disposable plastic drinking-water bottles sold each year in the U.S. Far less is understood about the contents of those bottles. Bottled water was an $18.5 billion(wholesale) industry in the U.S. in 2017, but under Presidents of both parties, FDA oversight has been lightly staffed.

但是很少有文章关注到瓶子里水的质量的问题。在美国瓶装水的市场价值$18.5亿. 但是在2017年，在美国两党的带领之下，美国食品和药物管理局却很少关注瓶装水中水的质量问题。
