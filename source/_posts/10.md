The truth, but unfortunately, is that few of us really absorb the information we receive. We filter out what we don't expect or want to hear, and this tendency doesn't necessarily improve with age. As a result, leaders simply miss a great deal of the information that's available -- a weakness to which top performers are especially vulnerable because overconfidence so often comes with success.
