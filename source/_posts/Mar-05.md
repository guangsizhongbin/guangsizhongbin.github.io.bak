Beauty and the bloke: why more men are wearing makeup

In 2017 barely concealed sniggers greeted the reveal that French president Emmanuel Macron spent €26, 000 (£22, 000) on makeup in his first three months in office. And in December, the Washington Post hinted that Donald Trump used Bronx Color concealer, which was gleefully reported elsewhere.

In a vlog entitled “Is it OK for guys to wear makeup?” beauty blogger Jake Jamie contextualises the rise of male makeup with toxic masculinity and mental health issues, stemming from the “strong and silent” archetype. “Makeup, ” by contrast he says, “enables me to walk down the street with my head held high feeling like the very best version of myself.” It feels like a statement of generational rebellion, as much as a body positive sales pitch. The message is that men’s makeup is a route to happiness, confidence and self actualisation.

But, interestingly, although men are happier to buy makeup, they don’t want to seem like they’re wearing it. For all this talk about confidence, the clandestine element of men’s makeup is still significant. As is women’s validation around its use.

“Above everything, I think that it will be women who contribute the most to its normalisation, ” says Alex Dalley, who launched male beauty company MMUK in 2011. “There are so many women out there who don’t mind their boyfriends or husbands wearing a touch of concealer or foundation, as long as it’s discreet. If women continue to really get on board with this, men over 30 in particular will be more encouraged to experiment with these types of products.”
