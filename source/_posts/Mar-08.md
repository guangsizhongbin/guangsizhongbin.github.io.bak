Parents grapple with E-learning as Chinese schools stay shut

The weeks-long closure of schools over virus fears across China is testing kids — and their parents.
Working mom Chen Yan has taken to installing a surveillance camera at home to see what her 12-year-old son is up to during the day while she’s at the office in Guangdong province.
So far, she’s caught him doing everything but studying, including napping while live-streamed lessons play in the background. “We can’t hear a single sentence from the teacher smoothly given the slow Internet, ” she said. “And I’m sure the teacher won’t notice if my son is listening in a 60-student class.”
China’s novel coronavirus outbreak has forced millions of parents across China to share space with their children schooling from home as campuses from the elementary to university level extend closures through March.
It’s been an unexpected boon for one industry: online education, which now must figure out how to engage students accustomed to classroom interaction. While parents are suffering, Chinese online education companies are stunned at their good fortune. What was a fiercely-competitive, cash-burning market segment is now one of the few business winners from the health crisis.
The boost to online learning platforms may ebb away quickly after the epidemic passes.
“There’s no guarantee that this short-term boom can be turned into long-term growth, ” said Yvette Chan, Hong Kong-based managing director at consultancy Alvarez & Marsal. “Companies need to have high-quality learning platforms to keep students in the virtual classrooms.”
For kids already steeped in the digital age, the addition of one more screen to their daily lives might be more seamless than for their bedraggled parents.
