<span id="inline-red">归纳不推理</span>
原文：四十多岁的人和三十多岁的人经营公司的结果是不一样的。
选项：年纪对于经营公司而言很重要。

原文：和客户沟通要打电话；和领导沟通要面谈； 给下级布置任务要发邮件
选项：和不同的人交流要用不同的方式

原文：选择入伍他会是一名将军，选择从政他会是一名州长，选择经商他会有自己的上市公司，选择科研他会拿下诺贝尔奖。

以上的表达都没有推理，只是归纳找出了并列内容的共同特征。

原文：选择入伍他会是一名将军，选择从政他会是一名州长，选择经商他会有自己的上市公司，选择科研他会拿下诺贝尔奖。
选项：选择演戏他会拿下奥斯卡。

Many of today’s younger workers – who make up almost half of the US workforce – grew up in a world of diplomas for graduating fourth grade, likes for Facebook comments, rewards for behaving well at parties and even medals when their little league teams finished last. It is also a generation that wants to be heard and wants to work for bosses that respect their feedback.

A. They are at fault for making an unstable workforce.
B. They are not as competent as the older workers.
C. They are raised in an accommodating environment.
